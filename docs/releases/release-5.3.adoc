== Release 5.3

=== New features and improvements

 - https://hub.docker.com/_/rapidoid/[Official Docker repository] for Rapidoid: `docker run rapidoid --help`
 - Maven plug-in for simple & easy packaging of uber-JAR: `mvn org.rapidoid:app:build` - it works on any Maven project, without configuring anything
 - Maven plug-in for simple & easy application deployment on multiple servers: `mvn org.rapidoid:app:deploy` - it works on any Maven project, requires deploy.yml
 - fine-grained activation of built-in services through command-line parameters: `docker run -p 8888:8888 rapidoid`
 - new API for super-easy recursive file search by name patterns and type: `IO.find("pom.xml").files().in(location).recursive().getLocations()`
 - high-performance in-memory cache with fluent API and basic statistics: `Cache<String, Integer> lengths = Caching.of((String key) -> key.length()).ttl(1000).build()`
 - fine-grained scope control in the authentication tokens
 - stronger security - AES and HMAC cryptography utils were re-written from scratch: `byte[] enc = Crypto.encrypt(msg.getBytes())`
 - new built-in status service, serving application and system status information
 - new built-in processes service for management of child processes
 - new built-in discovery service for simple peer discovery (transient)
 - new built-in echo service for debugging received requests
 - improved deployment process with 2-phase application JAR staging + deployment
 - many new end-to-end tests for Rapidoid's Docker container integration
 - improved logger, enriched API, also configured as default commons-logging implementation: `Log.info("Super-simple and cool!");`
 - improved generic request pipeline processing (low-level Net API)
 - convenient way to define and display custom metrics
 - built-in mysql and postgres profiles for `JDBC` and `Hibernate` configuration
 - hot reloading upon external configuration changes
 - super-simple SQL-powered RESTful services and GUI pages
 - Simplified job scheduling: `Jobs.after(3).seconds().run(() -> {})`
 - constructor-based dependency injection
 - optional integration with `Guice`
 - salted password hash generator (for the users configuration): `docker run -it --rm rapidoid password`
 - several bug fixes
 - many small improvements

=== Breaking changes

 - changes in the low-level async Net API - added `void resume(long connId, long handle, AsyncLogic asyncLogic)`
 - renamed URIs for the built-in services from `/_/*` to `/_*`
 - removed the factory utils from the Goodies (please use normal instantiation instead)
